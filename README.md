# Binary-dynamics-in-astrophysical-environment


The fundamental process of detecting gravitational waves (GW) memory from compact binary dynamics has so far overlooked a crucial factor, i.e, the influence of the astrophysical environment. All of the research is based on GW memory from binaries in a vacuum. In this study, we have, for the very first time, calculated the effect of dark matter (DM) environment on memory from binaries in both bound and unbound orbits. Specifically, we looked into nonlinear memory from non-spinning intermediate-mass-ratio binaries and found environment has a considerable effect on memory, which can be detected by future space-based detectors like LISA, GWSat. We have looked into two DM profiles, namely Minispike and Navarro-Frank-White (NFW), and observed their effect on memory from a binary in elliptic and hyperbolic orbits. We have also empirically incorporated the effect of DM density evolution in the case of a quasicircular orbit for the minispike profile. Our result strengthens the hereditary feature of the past binary evolution effect on building nonlinear memory. Overall, our work bridges the gap between the effect of DM environment on memory, which is a consequence of the strong field prediction of general relativity.
