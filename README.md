# Nonlinear-GW-memory-in-astrophysical-environment


We present the first study of how dark matter environments affect nonlinear gravitational
memory from intermediate-mass-ratio binaries. Modeling dark matter effects—gravity, dynamical
friction, and accretion—we compute nonlinear memory for bound and unbound orbits under dark
matter minispikes and Navarro-Frenk-White profiles. We have also empirically accounted for the
evolution of dark matter density in the case of quasi-circular orbits within a minispike profile.
Our findings show notable deviations from the vacuum case, with important implications for the
detectability of gravitational memory by future gravitational wave detectors, highlighting the role
of astrophysical environments in gravitational memory. Thus, our results strengthen the hereditary
feature of the past binary evolution effect on building nonlinear memory and work as a bridge
between dark matter environment and memory.
